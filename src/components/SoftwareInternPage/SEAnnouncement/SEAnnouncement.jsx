          As many internships have been suspended, or even cancelled, Ardent
          Labs aims to continue bringing quality internship programs to everyone
          at home during the crisis. During our 8-10 weeks virtual spring
          internship, interns will have the opportunity to learn modern web
          development tools by working on multiple milestone projects.
