This is my first React project where I tried to clone [ardentlabs.io](https://www.ardentlabs.io/). It is one of the required milestones that all interns must complete to continue. I recommend viewing this site on a computer because it is not mobile responsive.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js
2. Clone this repository
3. Enter the folder and type `npm install` in the terminal
4. Type `npm start` and it will be hosted on `localhost:3000`

## Technology Used

- React (create-react-app)
- React Router
- react-router-hash-link
- react-scroll

## Versioning

I used Git bash for versioning.
